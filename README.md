## Simple Dockerized Blog powered by Ruby on Rails
#### Created by following the Ruby on Rails [tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

This is a simple dockerized blog powered by Ruby on Rails.  It is unstyled at the moment as it was mainly used to learn Ruby on Rails, Dockerization and more about CRUD operations.  The rails app itself was created by following [this tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).  Since I also wanted to learn Docker, I worked with [Christopher Grimm](https://github.com/Grimmopher) on understanding Docker and how to get Rails and it working together.

I have begun using the techniques I learned from this tutorial to create a dockerized  backend for my current image gallery React apps ([here](https://github.com/velossien/photo-gallery) and [here](https://github.com/velossien/FolejoDePuertoNuevo)).  Right now I am using two repos ([Rails Repo](https://github.com/velossien/railsgalleryapitest), [React Repo](https://github.com/velossien/reactgallerytest)) to play around with this.  Once I have all the CRUD operations hooked up and working, I will connect both React image galleries I have made to an API-only Rails backend.
